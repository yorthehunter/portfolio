      <h2 class="weave-h4">Summary</h2>
      <p>I aspire to improve the experiences of others through a foundation of empathy, observation, and reaction. This often manifests through web and mobile user interfaces, but can also be in strong interpersonal relationships.</p>
      <p>TL;DR: I like to make people happy.</p>

  <h2 class="weave-h4 u-text-center">What else do I do with ALL of my free time??</h2>
  <p>I have two young boys that wreck and thrash and scream and help make my life whole. As an experience designer that depends on using empathy as a tool, it's so nice to have these two little guys to help me explore the farthest stretches of emotion.</p>
  <p>I also am relentlessly and openly nostalgic. I love 80s action movies, I collect retro boxed video games, and I live in an old victorian house full of antiques. Nope, these things don't necessarily make me a better designer.</p>
  <p>I've been designing things for years, even in the physical world (I almost wrote "analog world"). I <em>sometimes</em> <a href="http://yorthehunter.deviantart.com/">draw charcoal portraits</a> and <em>every once-in-a-while</em> I may do some digital artwork and <em>very infrequently</em> I may do some watercolor or pen work. I also love to work on my old house: painting walls, stripping baseboards, and hanging drywall.</p>
  <p>I'd love to have a drink with youâ€”your choice: Tequila, scotch, coffee, La Croix, bubble tea.</p>
