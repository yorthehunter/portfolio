## Problem Statement

At Stitch Fix, we build product—sometimes efficiently, sometimes not—within a disjointed and loose set of design frameworks. Without a set of consistent guidelines, design decisions are often made impromptu and development becomes slowed down, less efficient, and at the sacrifice of good UX.

## The Goal of Weave

### TL;DR

**Empowerment**: Through a *collaborative* effort, we establish *vetted design patterns* for common usability issues, *reusable components* for rapid development, and an accessible *design system* as a single source of truth for consistency. Product is designed and built faster and more reliably.

### Parts of the Goal Defined

##### Collaborative

* We work on separate product suites but our business and user goals are aligned, so we stay connected on what it means to build products for expert users at Stitch Fix
* In order to make valuable progress, we choose to be federated: spread our expertise across functions and contribute as often as we’re able

##### Vetted Design Patterns

* Design vetting is happening all the time: design critiques, meetings, Slack, water-cooler chats
* We establish patterns as we need them, present them to each other, iterate as needed, and implement

##### Reusable Components

* The UI layer is built from reusable parts, not page-by-page
* These reusable parts are built individually from system-wide specifications and smaller parts, giving us a constrained set to choose from and a consistent visual identity

##### Design System

* Encompasses the style guide, principles, component code, and any other living part of Weave
* The design system is centralized and accessible
* It’s a system of parts, updated with new information like any other system we maintain


## Our Practice

### Consistency

* We share designs in a central location
* Our designs share a common visual theme
* Interactions are designed to be well understood by the user

### Efficiency

* Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) methodologies
* We work quickly, vetting things as we go, checking each other’s work constantly, and using each other’s designs to solve similar UX problems
* We work to our varied strengths as product designers

### Simplicity
* Users understand the UI
* Animations are brief and meaningful
* We solve UI problems by building upon the basic foundations in our component library
* We ask ourselves "Has this problem already been solved?"
    * If so, we have a design for it
    * If not, we have something new to add to the design system

### Scalability

* Designers understand the Way We Design™
* Developers understand the Way We Develop™
* Business partners understand the Way We Produce™
* Maintaining one system is easier than maintaining 100 systems separately

### Reality

* We’re not solving 100% of the problems
* We’re taking the shared UX of our many expert-use applications and turning it into a design system, knowing that we will still need to solve specific problems as they arise
* We learn from our mistakes
* We work as effectively and rapidly as we can, even though our teams might be small and busy
* Speed of development and UI performance over cosmetics
* Consistency of design and interactions over unique branding
* We’re led by the user, we don’t lead the user
* Functionality first, deep user engagement and aesthetics later
