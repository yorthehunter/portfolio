## Definition

The Z-Depth refers to the visual depth of an "elevated" element, represented by a drop shadow.

- Flat elements fall naturally in the z-depth 0 plane
- Most elements that are "raised" are in the z-depth 1 plane
- Some components have a specific z-depth associated with them, defined in their component code
- [More reading at Material Design](https://material.google.com/material-design/elevation-shadows.html)
