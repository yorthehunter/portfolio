## Definition
Dialogs are conversations with the user. Some ask for input back, others are just messages with varying degrees of user attention.
- [More reading about Material Design dialogs](https://material.google.com/components/dialogs.html)

-----

## Alerts
- **Highest attention**: when you need to slap the user in the face
-	use when you need a step between
-	forces the focus of the screen on the dialog
-	forces user to take action
-	text is minimal and to the point
-	button labels describe the action e.g "Cancel \| Process" instead of "no \| yes"
-	***Do NOT overuse!!*** Or you will take the user out of their flow.

## Banners
- **Medium attention**: When the SYSTEM wants to converse with the USER
- Butts under the top nav
- Attention grabbing, but dismissable
- Push content down, they don’t cover
- Animates in on page load
- Static, not fixed position
- Error, neutral, and success versions
- If user need to act on the information, then provide a link or action button as necessary
- Do not use if the message is going to occur over and over, thus lessing the impact

### Error Banner
-	Watermelon BG, white text
-	Use for system errors that cause the page to reload, errors caused by the actions of the user, or any other “red-alert” style messages

### Visual
<aside class="weave-banner weave-banner--error">
  <section class="weave-banner__message">Something has gone horribly wrong and you need to hear about it and oh god it’s bad, so do whatever you have to do to fix it right away!</section>
  <section class="weave-banner__close"></section>
</aside>

### Markup
{{ TODO }}

-----

### Warning Banner
-	Yellow BG, normal text color (dark gray)
-	Warning banners are softer in tone than error messages, but relay a message that encourages action.
-	Warning banners can be passive or active (can have an optional action for the user or be a standalone message)

### Visual
<aside class="weave-banner weave-banner--warning">
  <section class="weave-banner__message">This is a warning or nudge that something is different. Not necessarily bad nor good, just... different.</section>
  <section class="weave-banner__close"></section>
</aside>

### Markup
{{ TODO }}

-----

### Info Banner
•	Mint lightest BG, normal text color (dark gray)
•	Use for administrative messages to the user (e.g. changes to the system, updates, etc)
•	Info banners are positive or neutral in their messaging.

### Visual
<aside class="weave-banner weave-banner--info">
  <section class="weave-banner__message">Here’s a bit of information: everything is swell. Keep up the good work.</section>
  <section class="weave-banner__close"></section>
</aside>

### Markup
{{ TODO }}

-----

### Success Banner
•	Dark Mint BG, white text
•	Appears after a big event successfully finishes (e.g. successful sign in or sign out, or a must-act form submitted successfully)
•	Use minimally, since the banner is a high-visibility dialog; consider inline messaging or icon usage, etc.

### Visual
<aside class="weave-banner weave-banner--success">
  <section class="weave-banner__message">Your action caused something good to happen! Success!!</section>
  <section class="weave-banner__close"></section>
</aside>

### Markup
{{ TODO }}

-----

### Expandable Banner
If a banner has a longer message in which the user MAY be interested but is not actionable, use an expandable banner to hold the content.

## Notifications
- **Low attention**: Recognizable with barely a glance

### Notification Badge
-	Use to indicate that something has changed “behind the scenes” and that a user should check it out when they have the chance
-	These are very low impact: the user attends to them when it’s convenient
-	Badges dismiss once a user views that content

### "Snackbar"
-	The snackbar is for showing very short system messages
-	Basically “your last action worked, and here is a generic way to tell you that!”
-	One line of text with optional singular action button
-	Never contains a dismiss or cancel button because snackbar is self-dismissing
-	Animates in from the bottom of the screen (Fig. 1)
