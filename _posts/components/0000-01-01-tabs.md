## Definition
- We don’t want to show all of the information at once, allowing us to save on space in the view
- We have chunks of information that are contextually similar but that don’t need to be shown at the same time
- Each chunk of information can be clearly defined by a short tab label
  - These labels need to clearly state to the user what information they will find within each tabbed section
- Usually, each chunk contains entirely discrete information from every other tabbed chunk
  <!-- - For the example below, we would expect that “assignments” contains no overlapping info with “stats” but that each tab will all be information gathered about the main context (Ellen Obriadtchikova’s data). -->
- We want the user to be able to quickly navigate between them as their situation requires

### Usage

- Tabs are for switching between views in the same context
- Tabs are **not** for navigating a site
- Do **not** use tabs if the user needs to compare two sections of content at the same time
- It should be very clear to the user the content that the tabs are referencing
- One tab should ALWAYS be preselected
- Tab labels are very short (one or two words) but easy to understand in context
- Tabs are only in one row
