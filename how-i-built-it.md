## How I Built This Site

Initially, I was working on a Jekyll site using gh-pages for simplicity. However, in order to keep proprietary information safe, I decided to deploy to heroku behind a super-simple authentication. In order to keep the code I had (and the work flow I'm used to), I [deployed my Jekyll site to Heroku](http://daverupert.com/2015/02/jekyll-heroku-dropbox/).

I was so proud when it actually worked!

### The rest is custom CSS and HTML

If you came to this page looking for how I **coded** this site, then you probably want to actually see the source code. You can see [the source of this (fully responsive) site on GitHub](https://github.com/yorthehunter/portfolio), but realize that the actual content is hidden to maintain property rights.
