### What problem are you trying to solve?

At Stitch Fix, we build product—sometimes efficiently, sometimes not—within a disjointed and loose set of design frameworks. Without a set of consistent guidelines, design decisions are often made impromptu and development becomes slowed down, less efficient, and at the sacrifice of good UX.

### Our Goal

Empowerment: Through a collaborative effort, we establish vetted design patterns for common usability issues, reusable components for rapid development, and an accessible design system as a single source of truth for consistency. Product is designed and built faster and more reliably.

### Our Approach
