### What problem are you trying to solve?

Returns Manager 1.0 doesn’t reflect the physical process involved in sorting and moving returned items back into inventory. The information presented to the user isn’t logically organized, nor does the hierarchy of information reflect the mental model of the returns processor (the user).

In addition to an outdated user experience, the ability to scale both our systems and our returns processes were quickly coming to a head.

### Our Goal

Empowerment: Through a collaborative effort, we establish vetted design patterns for common usability issues, reusable components for rapid development, and an accessible design system as a single source of truth for consistency. Product is designed and built faster and more reliably.

### Our Approach
